- Goal of optimization
  - Maximize/mimize some goals/objectives subject of a set of constraints, which often come from the fact that activities need to be planned to compete for resources (budgets, machines, workers, etc).
  - **Reason** to use math. opt. is that often times the number of potential/feasible solutions can be astronomical, such that it is prohibited to use brute-force or naive method to find the optimal solution.
- Drives for adoptions of optimization/MIPs.
  - More data from businesses and increased computational powers.
- Industries where optimization/MIPs are applied.
  - Supply industry
  - Sports industry
